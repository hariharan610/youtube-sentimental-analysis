* This repository contains the frontend code for an ML-based model that analyzes comments and rates videos.
*  The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface for users to input video comments, view the analysis, and see the rating of the videos.

# Project Overview
## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create an intuitive and efficient frontend interface that interacts with an ML-based backend model. The model analyzes user comments on videos and provides a rating based on the sentiment and content of the comments. This can help users quickly gauge the quality and reception of a video based on the analysis of its comments.

## Key Features
* User Input: Allows users to input comments related to a video.
* Real-time Analysis: Sends the comments to the backend ML model for real-time analysis and displays the results.
* Video Rating: Shows a consolidated rating of the video based on the analyzed comments.
* Interactive UI: Provides a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Components
The frontend is structured into several key components:
* Input Form: A text area where users can input their comments.
* Analysis Display: A section that shows the results of the comment analysis, including sentiment scores and key highlights.
* Rating Display: A visual representation of the video's overall rating based on the analyzed comments.

## Technologies Used
* HTML5 & CSS3: For the basic structure and styling of the web pages.
* JavaScript: For interactive features and dynamic content updates.
* React: For building the user interface components and managing state.
* Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend ML model.
